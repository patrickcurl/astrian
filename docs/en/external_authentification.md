# Provide external authentification to Agorakit

!> External authentification is not working curently. I have fery few (if any) people ask for it. It is a privacy invading feature so no developement has been done on ths front. Feel free to submit PR if you want this.


Some day, you will be able to  provide facebook, google, twitter and/or github authentication to your users.

This feature is a work in progress, help is highly welcome.

To do so, get a client id, a client secret from each provider you want to use. Those are a string of characters you need to put in your .env file

Agorakit will automatically put the links on the login and registration page for each provider when [PROVIDER]_ID is set

- For Twitter go to : https://apps.twitter.com/app/new
- For Facebook, go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps
- For Github go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new
- For Google go to : http://console.developers.google.com/

It's a bit of a pain to find where to get the client_id and client_key, so good luck :-)

You also need to set [PROVIDER]_URL to http[s]://[yourdomain]/auth/[provider]/callback for each provider, in your .env file
